# TOPIC : DOM Manipulation

## Instructions

This app is a very basic calculator who is supposed to do exactly one thing and fails miserably.
A user should be able to select two numbers. When clicking the "Add Numbers" button these numbers should be added together. The Result should be displayed after clicking the button.
Can you debug this program?

## Restrictions

You are not allowed to log anything to the console.

## Hints

-   use incognito-mode to minimize distractions
-   use the debugger in your browser to check at each step in your scripts what the values of certain variables are
-   use the network tab to see which documents are loaded
-   don't be afraid to use a search engine to look for terms you don't know yet

## Goals

The goal of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to get familiar with the dev tools and how they can help you to debug any program.
